einstein-factory=Einstein factory: Uses Einsten's equation (mass-energy equivalence) to transform electricity into matter.\nPlease don't use it with quality, it's not supposed to work. :). If you find a way to make it work, that's a bug, and you can't recycle it when I fix it.\nGraphics courtesy of Hurricane, see the mod page for more info.
